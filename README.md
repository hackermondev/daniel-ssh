# daniel.is-a.dev (ssh version)

### What is this?
I built a SSH server written in Golang that lets you basically view my website all from the terminal. You can SSH into the server and then run different commands and view different things from my website entirely from the terminal.

Greatly inspired from [@quackduck](https://github.com/quackduck) [ssh chat](https://github.com/quackduck/devzat)

### Stack
It is written in Golang. Huge thanks to the [github.com/gliderlabs/ssh](https://github.com/gliderlabs/ssh) package as it does most of the work with the ssh server.

### How to use.

Since I don't have a server, I am hosting it on Replit and tunneling it with ngrok. First go to [daniel.is-a.dev/ssh](https://daniel.is-a.dev/ssh) to get the ngrok tunnel url. You can connect to the server with the link it provides you & and the port. The link can change anytime though.
